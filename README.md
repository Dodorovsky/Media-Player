# DK_9000

A retro-inspired media player built with Python/Tkinter, born from the idea of DJ software and expanded through cinema.  
DK_9000 started as a simple audio project and evolved into a creative tool with playlists, radio streams, video playback, and compact UI modes.  
This is my first project developed with AI assistance: Copilot acted as a tutor, helping me push the code further than a basic tutorial.
