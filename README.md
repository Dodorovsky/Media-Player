# DK_9000

A retro-inspired media player built with Python/Tkinter, born from the idea of DJ software and expanded through cinema.  
DK_9000 started as a simple audio project and evolved into a creative tool with playlists, radio streams, video playback, and compact UI modes.  
This is my first project developed with AI assistance: Copilot acted as a tutor, helping me push the code further than a basic tutorial.

## Motivation
DK_9000 started as a simple media player project — the foundation for any DJ software since it handles audio. Later, I decided to introduce video support, which was a real challenge, but as a cinema lover it became one of the most rewarding parts of the project.

## Learning Journey
I have been studying Python for about 3 years, with ups and downs.  
Courses such as [Píldoras Informáticas by Juan Díaz](https://www.pildorasinformaticas.es/) and [Cristian Koch’s Pygame course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-python-by-making-games/) gave me the foundation to build DK_9000 without losing control of the project.

## Copilot as Instructor
This is my first project where I used AI assistance. Copilot acted as a tutor, guiding me through modularization, debugging, and expanding the player far beyond the initial tutorial.

## Features
- Audio and video playback with automatic detection
- Playlist management with duplicate control
- A five-band equalizer, expandable with a dedicated button
- Floating overlay with playback controls
- Visual feedback: time indicators shift from grey to green during playback
- Random and loop modes for flexible listening
- Fullscreen mode for video
- Compact mode: +/- button hides the listbox or video frame
- Hotkeys for quick control (e.g. Left: skip back, M: mute)
- Help button showing all key bindings

## Radio Stations
DK_9000 includes four curated radio streams, reflecting different moods and influences:
- NTS: electronic and experimental
- KEXP: indie rock and alternative
- SomaFM: jazzy and eclectic
- Classic FM: timeless classical repertoire

## Installation
Clone the repository and run the main script:
