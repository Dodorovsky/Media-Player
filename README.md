DK_9000 started as a simple audio project and evolved into a creative tool with playlists, radio streams, video playback, and compact UI modes.  
This is my first project developed with Copilot assistance, helping me push the code further than a basic tutorial.

## Motivation
DK_9000 began as a simple media player — the foundation for any DJ software since it handles audio.  
Later, I decided to introduce video support, which was a real challenge, but as a cinema lover it became one of the most rewarding parts of the project.

## Learning Journey
I have been studying Python for about 3 years, with ups and downs.  
Courses such as *Píldoras Informáticas* by Juan Díaz and Cristian Koch’s Pygame course on Udemy gave me the foundation to build DK_9000 without losing control of the project.
