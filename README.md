# DK_9000 �
DK_9000 began as a simple media player — later I decided to introduce video support, which was a real challenge but rewarding as a cinema lover.

DK_9000 started as a simple audio project and evolved into a creative tool with playlists, radio streams, video playback, and compact UI modes.  
This is my first project developed with Copilot assistance, helping me push the code further than a basic tutorial.

## Motivation
DK_9000 began as a simple media player — the foundation for any DJ software since it handles audio.  
Later, I decided to introduce video support, which was a real challenge, but as a cinema lover it became one of the most rewarding parts of the project.
