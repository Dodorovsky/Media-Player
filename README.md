DK_9000 – Retro Media Player (Python / Tkinter)

DK_9000 is a retro-inspired desktop media player built with Python and Tkinter.
It reproduces audio and video, offers multiple UI modes, playlists, radio stations, and a 5-band EQ.
This project started as a personal Python application and has grown into a hands-on learning platform for software testing, QA, and automation.

## Features
- Audio and video playback with automatic detection  
- 4 pre-configured radio stations
- Playlist management (add/remove)
- Mute, random, loop, and EQ (5 bands)
- Multiple UI modes: default, compact, fullscreen with overlay for video
- Keyboard shortcuts for playback control

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

DK_9000 also serves as a QA-focused learning project, where testing is integrated into development.

Manual Testing:

- Verification of UI behavior in all modes (default, compact, fullscreen)
- Bug reproduction in playback, playlists, and EQ settings
- Regression testing after feature updates or code refactoring
- Edge case testing and state transition validation

Automation (initial / ongoing):

- Python-based scripts to test core functionality
- User flow and state transition testing
- Future plans: expand automated tests with Pytest or Playwright

This project demonstrates hands-on learning in QA, automated testing, and software quality practices while building a functional application.
